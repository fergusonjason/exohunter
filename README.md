# Purpose

This is my tool to create Lightkurve plots from Kepler, K2, and TESS missions. After all, why do something manually in 30
minutes when you can spend 20 hours automating it, right?

# Usage

Right now, load the project into VS Code and hit the run button. This is my first Python project, so beyond that, I barely
know what I'm doing.

# Status

Right now I'm still working on the API. Once that's done, I'll create a React-based frontend to actually display what
the API creates.

I also need to set this up as a Docker image. Eventually.
